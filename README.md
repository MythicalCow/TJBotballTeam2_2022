# Welcome!
This is the github repository for the Botball Team #0143 from the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science Technology. We are team from the Northern Virginia Region that is excited to be participating in the Botball 2022 Season this year.

# Team Organization

### Building Team:

Our building teams will be separated into two subteams. One team will work on the Create robot and the other is responsible for the Chassis robot. Within these groups we will have members working on individual mechanisms like a claw or a shovel which we can then integrate into our robot.

### Programming Team:

Our programming team will also be separated into two subteams. One team is responsible for coding the Create robot and the other team will code the Chassis robot.

### Documentation:

We have different people taking pictures of progress throughout our meetings and we maintain an agenda as a team which details progress and goals for our meetings. This keeps members updated about work is done and what needs to be done. 

### Officers & Captains:

This team is composed of elected team members that are responsible for making sure the meeting runs smoothly and for writing documentation of each meeting.
